A Rust crate for CS510 - Rust Programming aiming to implement various basic board/card games.

This crate leverages the [GGEZ crate](https://github.com/ggez/ggez) for creating interactable 2D versions of common games. It allows users to select a game and play against AI opponents and potentially multiplayer games other live users as well. See the table below for the current status of games intended for playable use in this crate.

| Game       | Implementation Status              | AI Opponents | Multiplayer |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Connect 4  | In progress                        | In progress  | TBD         |
| Battleship | Intended for future implementation | TBD          | TBD         |
| Hearts     | Potential for implementation       | TBD          | TBD         |

For additional implementation on how to run and play each game, see the [How To Play a Game](#how-to-play-a-game) section further down in this README.
